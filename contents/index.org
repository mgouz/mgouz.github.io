* about-me
Hi there! My name's Matthew and I'm a software engineer.  I primarily have worked in web development building full stack applications, but have also done work in machine learning and building data pipelines.
My personal programming interests revolve around compiler design and operating systems.  I enjoy running, reading, creating art, and doing more programming in my free time.
